# MEAN Fullstack Hello-World

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a minimalist MEAN stack hello-world:

- A proof of concept
- A template to be used for future projects
- To learn about configurations that are required to reach a locally hosted full stack hosted website

- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Version Control: GitHub
- Database: MongoDB
- Frontend Framework: Angular
- Backend Framework: Express
- Backend Code: Node

## Installation and Setup

The steps below were taken to manage this project and reach the hello world state:
1)Set up a Trello board for task management: https://trello.com/b/nTZWOi2L/mean-hello-world
2)Create a directory on developer computer named "mean"
3)Open new directory within Visual Studio Code (IDE)
4)Create a README.md in the new directory to project information and setup steps
5)Setup Node and Express
    -Install Node on developer system from nodejs.org/en (follow installation instructions)
    -From command prompt, navigate to mean directory, then execute "npm init" and answer series of questions to create package.json
    -From command prompt, navigate to mean directory, then execute "npm install express"
(Remaning steps TBD)
